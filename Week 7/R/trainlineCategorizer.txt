 Give an option to find the cheapest tickets on a given day. Most people are flexible on a perticular day as to what time they can travlel. For example I have some family members from abroad wh I want to take to London but as there are 3 of us price matters. we are able to go any day within a weeks period so I spend time checking several days. Before I check them all I give up so possibly missing a good price.
