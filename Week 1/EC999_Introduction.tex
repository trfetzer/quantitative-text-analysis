\begin{frame}[fragile]{Some Organizatorial Issues}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Housekeeping: Visiting Prof at UChicago, usually based at University of Warwick in the UK. You can reach me on \url{tfetzer@uchicago.edu}.

\item About this course: this is still a relatively new course and you guys are the second cohort of students:

\begin{itemize}

\item Computational Linguistics

\item Machine Learning 

\item Data science

\item Statistics

\item Programming in R

\end{itemize}


\item Your input is needed: too slow, too fast, ...? just email me.

\item Assessment: I be based on 5 course assignments and a class project presented in week 10. 

\item Course Material: \url{http://www.trfetzer.com/ec999/}

\end{enumerate}


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Plan for the Course - Part 1}
First part will introduce simple NLP concepts, introduce the R language and illustrate how we can work with getting text into a useful format for subsequent analysis. The unit of analysis in the first part of the course will mainly be (short) sequences of words.  
\begin{enumerate}

\item Introduction: Motivation, setting up, examples, basic introduction to ``R''. 

\item Sourcing data: String manipulation, regular expressions, loading text data, basic web scraping, (social media) API's.

\item Text Normalization: Zipf's law, Herd's law, tokenization methods and routines, stemming, Levenshtein distance.

\item Describing Text: readability measures

\item Identifying and extracting collocations: heuristic and statistical methods.

\item Part-of-Speech Tagging.

\item N-Gram generative language model.

\item ...


\end{enumerate}


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Plan for the Course - Part 2}
In the second part, we will turn (larger) documents into a vector-space representation and perform (supervised) machine learning for classification type purposes. 
\begin{enumerate}

\item Vector Space model: vector space representation, bag of words model, measuring distance/ similarity between texts.

\item Ideological scaling: introduction to supervised learning concepts; naive LBK ideology scaling, Bayesscore.

\item Classification introduction: classification error types, measuring accuracy and bias-variance trade-off

\item kNN classification

\item Naive Bayes: Bernoulli versus Multi-nomial language models

\item Logistic regression: best subset selection, feature selection through regularized logistic regression

\item Application example: sentiment analysis

\end{enumerate}


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Plan for the Course - Part 3}
In the third part, we will turn to unsupervised learning methods for textual data. 
\begin{enumerate}

\item Unsupervised learning

\item K-Means clustering: k-medoids (PAM), importance of distance measures

\item Hierarchical clustering: different linkage 

\item Topic Modelling: static and dynamic

\end{enumerate}


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Organization}


\begin{itemize}

\item You will be asked to try to reproduce what is done on the lectures. Most slides are written using Markdown, which means the R-Code is executed on the fly behind the scenes.

\item Lectures, including sample source files, are made available on \url{http://www.trfetzer.com/EC999} 

\item Questions can be asked on \url{https://piazza.com/uchicago/spring2017/ph30570/}

\item Homework assignments  will ask you to perform some analysis and coding work. You are asked to produce an Markdown document (more later) that solves the assignment you were asked to do.

\item  Course project will involve own data analysis in groups 

\item \textbf{Teaching Assistant}: Alvaro Valdes Mena, avaldes@uchicago.edu - will be available for appointments.

\end{figure}
First step consists of definition of \emph{corpus}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Selecting texts: definition of corpus of texts and being aware of underlying selection criteria.

\item Conversion of texts into a common electronic format

\item Defining documents: what will be the unit of analysis
\begin{itemize}
\item Sentence, Paragraph, Section, Chapter,...
\end{itemize}

Second step typically consists of definition of features 
\begin{enumerate}

\item This can be word tokens, \emph{n-grams}, keywords, indicators, patterns: challenge is to identify \emph{meaningful} features

\item For example: classification tasks you want to identify words that are characteristic and informative about underlying classes.

\item \emph{Curse of dimensionality}: Feature selection often required/desirable.

\item Convert corpus-features into a numerically accessible data matrix $X$
\end{enumerate}

Third step involves analyzing data repesentation to achieve a give task.
\begin{enumerate}

\item Classification (=Prediction): estimating a function $\hat{f}$ that maps individual documents $x_i$ into specific classes (e.g. republican versus democrat, sentiment label,...)

\item Clustering: identify groups of documents $x_i$ that are similar because they belong to similar latent class $C$, without knowing the set of classes \emph{ex ante}.

  \item[stopwords] words that are excluded from text analysis for a range of reasons (typically lack of informational content)
  \item[complexity] word complexity usually measures the number of syllables
  \item[diversity] (lexical diversity) A measure of how many words occur per fixed word rate (a normalized vocabulary measure)

\item Beautiful feature of $R$ is its versatility due to the many extensions.

Factors are more efficiently stored compared to strings as they are coded as numeric values. It can be dangerous. Setting:

\code{options(stringsAsFactors=FALSE)}

ensures that when creating data frames, strings are not automatically replaced as factors.

R operates on named \emph{data structures}. The simplest such structure is a numeric vector, which is a single entity consisting of a collection of numbers.

A \code{data.table} is a list of vectors, just like a \code{data.frame}. However :

\begin{itemize}

\item it never has or uses rownames. Rownames based indexing can be done by setting a key of one or more columns or done ad-hoc using the on argument (now preferred).

\item it has enhanced functionality in [.data.table for fast joins of keyed tables, fast aggregation, fast last observation carried forward (LOCF) and fast add/modify/delete of columns by reference with no copy at all.

\item There are  several other methods that are available for operating on data.tables efficiently.

\item Especially machine read data (PDFs processed with Optical Character recognition - OCR)

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Text Encoding: A cautionary note}

\begin{itemize}
\item Especially working with data from different computer systems (Mac, Unix, Windows) and different languages, character encoding issues can occur.
\item The Latin character set (Encoding: \code{latin-1}) is used by English and most European languages, though the Greek character set is used only by the Greek language.

\item Loading data without knowing character encoding can sometimes cause errors

\item Text editors like Textwranger attempt to recognize character encoding

\item Most common encoding is \code{UTF-8}
