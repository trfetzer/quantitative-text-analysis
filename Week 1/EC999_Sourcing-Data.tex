%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Basic Manipulating of Strings in R}
After introducing the R-basics in the last lecture, we will turn to the basics of string manipulation. 
\begin{itemize}

\item Basic string manipulation functions

\item Regular Expressions, search and replace

\end{itemize}

Top string manipulation functions: - \code{tolower} (also \code{toupper}, capitalize) - \code{nchar} - \code{grep} - \code{gsub} - \code{substring} - \code{paste} and \code{paste0} - and the following from library stringr: \code{strtrim} , \code{str\_extract}, \code{str\_match}, \code{str\_split} but many more.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Case-folding for dimensionality reduction} 

As we will see, due to the curse of dimensionality, we will often simply ignore the case o individual words, as depending on the task at hand, the word case does not carry a lot of information.

\item The first Information Retrieval pipelines working off textual data were making heavy use of regular expressions.

\item Regular expressions, as the name indicates, is a pattern that describes a set of strings.

\item If a string matches a regular expression, it indicates that the presented string follows the pattern of the regular expression.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Naturalisation Processing Steps}

\begin{itemize}

\item Bulk download PDFs and bulk OCR processing using Abbyy Fine Reader (see further below)

\item Cleaning lines: removing characters that are not A-z, 0-9, -, ., (, ) 
\begin{knitrout}\tiny
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlstd{OUT} \hlkwb{<-} \hlkwd{gsub}\hlstd{(}\hlstr{"([^A-z0-9,;\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}-\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}.\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}(\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}) ])"}\hlstd{,} \hlstr{""}\hlstd{, OUT)}
\end{alltt}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}

\item \code{grep}ing of start and end lines 
\begin{knitrout}\tiny
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlstd{START} \hlkwb{<-} \hlkwd{grep}\hlstd{(}\hlstr{"Oaths of Allegiance|LIST OF ALIENS|CERTIFICATES OF NATURALISATION"}\hlstd{, TEMP,} \hlkwc{ignore.case} \hlstd{=} \hlnum{TRUE}\hlstd{)[}\hlnum{1}\hlstd{]}

\hlstd{END} \hlkwb{<-} \hlkwd{grep}\hlstd{(}\hlstr{"foregoing|SUMMARY|The list contains"}\hlstd{, TEMP,} \hlkwc{ignore.case} \hlstd{=} \hlnum{TRUE}\hlstd{)}
\hlstd{END} \hlkwb{<-} \hlstd{END[END} \hlopt{>} \hlstd{START][}\hlnum{1}\hlstd{]}
\end{alltt}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}

\item \code{str\_split}ing by separation character ";" to separate different pieces; 


\item regex for date extraction, something like:  \code{([0-9]+)(rd|th|st)?  ([A-z]{3,})\\,? ([0-9]{4})\$} 

\item and a whole bunch of further refinements...

\end{itemize}

Here, information retrieval does not require a big statistical machinery: simple rules work well as the text data is broadly consistently formatted.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Accessing Textual Data}

\begin{itemize}

\item Textual data can be stored in multiple different formats

\begin{itemize}
\item JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format for structured data.
\item structured XML 
\item Flat text files
\item (machine readable?) PDFs
\item Word
\item Data bases
\end{itemize}

\item Parsing or reading text data into R can be achieved by a range of functions.
\end{itemize}

Newt Gingrich and the Republican leadership must not continue to hold the House and the American people hostage while they push their disastrous 7-year balanced budget plan.

## [2] "{\"congress\":104,\"title\":\"MEETING THE CHALLENGE\",\"text\":\"Mr. Speaker, a relationship, to work and survive, has got to be honest and we have got to deal with each other in good faith. For a government to govern well, we have to be honest and we have to deal with each other in good faith.\\nThe President has vetoed every measure we have sent to him that would balance the budget. He has a constitutional right to do that. If he believes that our budget devastates the elderly, he has a moral obligation to fight us. I will never, never say bad things about somebody that follows their beliefs because that is what they should do. There comes a time, though, that one has an obligation to do more than just say no.\\nMr. President, if you do not like our view of a balanced budget, give us your view. We cannot negotiate against ourselves anymore. You have a legal and a moral obligation to fight us when you think we are wrong. You have a legal and moral obligation to fulfill your commitment you made 40 days ago to put a budget on the table that balances. Please fulfill your obligation.\",\"chamber\":\"House\",\"speaker_party\":\"R\",\"date\":\"1996-01-04\",\"speaker_name\":\"Lindsey Graham\"}"

## [3] "{\"congress\":104,\"title\":\"DISPOSING OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1643, EXTENSION OF MOST-FAVORED- NATION TREATMENT FOR BULGARIA\",\"text\":\"Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.\\nMr. Speaker, this legislation is both good news and bad news. The good news is that the Republicans have finally decided to stop holding three-quarters of a million American Federal workers as hostage. In Vermont we have close to 2,000 Federal workers who are working today but are not getting paid. These people have mortgages to pay. They have children to feed. They have financial obligations to meet. It is immoral. It is wrong to hold them and every other Federal Worker who is furloughed and not being paid as hostage.\\nIt is also wrong to hold millions of Americans who need passports, who need environmental protection, who need Meals on Wheels, who need all of the services that this Government should be providing as hostage, who have paid for these services but are not getting them.\\nThe bad news is that, while Federal workers will be paid, many of them will not be given the resources that they need to do their jobs properly. That is insane. Why do we give people the money to go to work but then not allow them the resources to properly fulfill their function?\\nMr. Speaker, the truth of the matter is that this is not a debate about a 7-year balanced budget. If our Republican friends were serious about balancing the budget in 7 years, which I think can be done, they would not be spending $50 billion more on defense spending despite the end of the cold war. They would not be spending more money on the CIA despite the end of the cold war. They would not be giving huge tax breaks to the rich when the richest people in America today are richer than they have ever been before.\",\"chamber\":\"House\",\"speaker_party\":\"I\",\"date\":\"1996-01-05\",\"speaker_name\":\"Bernie Sanders\"}"

## [4] "{\"congress\":104,\"title\":\"EXAMINING THE SPEAKER'S UPCOMING TRAVEL SCHEDULE\",\"text\":\"Mr. Speaker, if we want to understand why in this country the richest people are becoming richer while most working people are seeing a decline in their standard of living, if we want to understand why the Contract With America provides for huge tax breaks for the wealthiest people and the largest corporations while it cuts back massively on programs for the elderly, working people, and low-income people, we might want to examine Newt Gingrich's travel schedule for the coming week.\\nMr. Gingrich will be in Seattle, WA, where he will have dinner with his colleagues and his friends for the Washington State Republican Party for $1,000 each. He will be in Dallas, TX, for a dinner for only $10,000 apiece. He will be in Dearborn, MI, for another private fireside reception at $10,000.\\nWho goes to these events? Most people that I know do not spend $1,000 for a dinner.\",\"chamber\":\"House\",\"speaker_party\":\"I\",\"date\":\"1996-01-05\",\"speaker_name\":\"Bernie Sanders\"}"

## [5] "{\"congress\":104,\"title\":\"FLOODING IN PENNSYLVANIA\",\"text\":\"Mr. President, I wanted to follow up the remarks of my senior Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], and talk about the problems that we are having in Pennsylvania today. The first thing I wanted to do was make sure the record is very clear in my use of the word \\\"liberal.\\\" I suggested that FEMA be more liberal than what they have been to date, as of early this morning, in declaring counties in Pennsylvania eligible for individual assistance, for emergency disaster relief funds. I think that was an appropriate call given the fact that the Governor of Pennsylvania, who knows a little bit about the Emergency Relief Act that is in place here because he helped write it several years ago and knows it cover to cover, declared 58 of Pennsylvania's 67 counties disaster areas and was seeking Federal grant recognition for, if not all, certainly a great majority of those counties.\\nSenator Specter, I know, has been traveling the State extensively, as have I. We have seen the tremendous damage done by this heavy snowfall and subsequent quick melting and floods and then freezing again, causing ice jams and horrible damage on our Commonwealth's rivers and streams. We do believe that several more counties should be included in the list that are eligible for individual assistance, and obviously the process will commence to determine whether those counties and municipalities will be eligible for public assistance, for reimbursing municipalities and counties for the cost of cleanup and dealing with the problems of this horrible storm.\\nI understand that the senior Senator has already talked about how today James Lee Witt, the head of FEMA, has been up to the State of Pennsylvania and he has added to the list of 6 counties an additional 19 counties, bringing to 25 the number of counties that will now be eligible for some assistance.\\nWe were in Harrisburg this morning. I know he mentioned we saw some of \\nThat has really made this disaster a lot different because Harrisburg was hit back in 1972 with very severe flooding as a result of Hurricane Agnes. In fact, the mayor and others have been telling us that while the flood levels were not as high as Hurricane Agnes, although in some areas they were almost as high, the damage, they believe, actually will be more because of the ice. Literally, Senator Specter and I were walking around an area that was 5 feet underwater just 24 hours before, and sitting there all over the place were boulders of ice almost my size and probably bigger, with trees frozen to them. It was really a rather gruesome picture. You could actually see the water level because on the houses and the fences and on the trees you could see where the ice had frozen around the tree, around the houses, sort of jutting out from the houses. So you could pretty well tell everywhere where the water levels had risen to.\\nWe were through that area and saw the damage that the ice had caused to streets and to houses, the buckling effect of having water there and then freezing and then unfreezing. It looks almost like an earthquake on some of the roads; they are just sort of warped, with big sinkholes and things like that as a result of this freezing and thawing and freezing again and the amount of water pressure.\\nIn fact, Senator Specter and I met with Mayor Reed of Harrisburg, whom I have to commend; he has done a tremendous job in rallying the troops in Harrisburg, one of our hardest hit cities, and is doing an outstanding job personally. He is someone whom I have known for quite some time and know he puts every ounce of his person in his job. I am sure he has not slept for days. He met us in boots and blue jeans and looked like he had not been able to get into his house, probably even to eat a meal, in a few days. He has really just been on the go.\\nThey had a horrible fire in this area I was talking about that was 5 feet under water. They had, unfortunately, a fire break out last night that destroyed four historic town homes. And luckily no one was injured. The area was evacuated obviously and no one was injured as a resident. But several of the firefighters, they had to cut their way through the ice and wade through water, waist high at that time, and fight the fire without obviously any fire hoses. They had to string them literally blocks to get fire hoses there.\\nMy understanding is that a dozen firefighters were carried from the scene with hypothermia -- a horrible situation. I know Mayor Reed was there the entire time working on it. He showed us the Walnut Street bridge, which is the oldest -- I am not going to get this right -- it is the oldest of some type of bridge having to do with metal construction. That bridge was expected to collapse during the 1972 flood when actually the river went up over the platform of the bridge.\\nIn this case it was several feet below it. But a section of the bridge -- you may have seen on television -- was knocked away. The reason was not because of the water flow. Again, it was the ice jams. An ice jam had a large amount of ice collected at this one abutment, and eventually with all the pressure it was knocked over, was knocked into the river. They expect another one of those pillars to fall relatively soon.\\nSo there has been a severe amount of damage. Senator Specter and I are very concerned about the Federal response to the damage across Pennsylvania. We believe that in some instances the response was delayed. I know the President would like to see all the people and communities that have been severely hurt by this storm to get the kind of assistance that they need to begin to clean up and rebuild their lives.\\nI am hopeful that we can move forward. As Senator Specter said, initially only six counties were listed as qualifying for this assistance. One of the counties that did not qualify originally, and did not qualify until this afternoon, was a county where there were 6 people known dead, 75 people missing from an area that was a large housing development that was literally just swept away. Water rose rapidly. People were given no warning. The consequences were terrible. Yet that county was not listed originally on the disaster list, which amazed many of us and frankly was very discouraging.\\nI had occasion to talk to people up in Williamsport, Lycoming County. And they were very discouraged. Somehow they were suffering to this degree, and in fact accounted, from my understanding, for over half the deaths related to this storm in the Northeast, and yet were not listed as a county eligible for disaster assistance. That caused some legitimate uneasiness to where actually their needs and concerns were being paid attention to. I am happy to report they were listed in the second round.\\nThere are other counties that we need to look at that I believe have legitimate needs to be met. Hopefully we can do that, we can do that expeditiously. I want to join Senator Specter in congratulating Secretary Pena and Director Witt for being up in Pennsylvania today to survey the damage, to see the extent of what seemed to be just a flood.\\nI remind you the compounding effect of the ice is something I do not think anyone recognized. I was in Lancaster County, which unfortunately has yet to be declared a disaster county.\\nI was in Marietta which was flooded, at least the parts nearest the river were flooded. Their big concern right now is the freezing that is going on. They were flooded. They have something like a dike. It is actually a railroad track that runs between the river and the town that is very high up and serves like a dike. But they got flooded through their storm sewers, and the water reaching its level filled up both sides of the dike. Now they are concerned with the storm sewers. Because of the very cold temperatures, they are now frozen. If they get any more rain, which is anticipated tomorrow, or any other precipitation, they will have the same problem all over again.\\nMany counties and many cities, they have that same problem with either frozen surface areas that prevent water from draining or the infrastructure underneath the ground itself containing ice and frozen debris is going to cause a real problem with drainage.\\nSo we are not out of the woods yet. There is unfortunately still a lot of snow on the ground. The possibility exists, with the warm weather today, we could even see some more problems. So I want to congratulate Governor Ridge and Lt. Gov. Mark Schweiker for their tremendous role in responding to this emergency. They have been all over the State, have been very aggressive in trying to seek aid, and have also been very aggressive in trying to help municipalities trying to deal with the problems that have beset them.\\nI think we have seen a very good effort on the part of locally elected officials, and the Governor and Lieutenant Governor. I think -- at least I hope that we can be proud of the Federal role that is being played in Pennsylvania. I think we are coming along a little slowly, but maybe today with some fly-arounds and other things that are going on, we can impress upon officials here in Washington and in the regional office that this is a true emergency, a disaster that needs to be attended to, and the Federal Government has a role to play in helping those individuals and municipalities that were affected by it.\\nMr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\",\"chamber\":\"Senate\",\"speaker_party\":\"R\",\"date\":\"1996-01-22\",\"speaker_name\":\"Rick Santorum\"}"

There are lots of possible encoding standards, they tend to vary by geographic location and by operating system. For example: Latin1 is common in Europe on Microsoft based systems, while MacOS uses Mac-OS Roman.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Reading and Parsing HTML Data}

\begin{itemize}

\item HTML is a markup language that is derived from the XML standard and is commonly interpreted in the browser.

\item HTML is made up of tags that encapsulate information on how elements inside the tag are to be presented visually in the browser.

\item Can define table-, image-, headline-, and paragraph environments, among many others.

\item There exist many direct ways of parsing HTML using existing R packages

\item HTML, just as any XML document has a tree structure with the whole content of the page being wrapped in a \code{body} environment. 

\item This tree structure allows each item in the document to be ``addressed'' by a path, each element has a unique \code{xpath}.

When used in the context of web development, an API is typically defined as a set of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request messages, along with a definition of the structure of response messages, which is usually in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.\\
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
The practice of publishing APIs has allowed web communities to create an open architecture for sharing content and data between communities and applications. In this way, content that is created in one place can be dynamically posted and updated in multiple locations on the web
-Wikipedia

\item Calls to APIs are sent through HTTP, so you can just call them using your browser\smallskip

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Types of Requests}

\begin{quote}
\code{GET} requests a representation of the specified resource. Note that GET should not be used for operations that cause side-effects, such as using it for taking actions in web applications. One reason for this is that GET may be used arbitrarily by robots or crawlers, which should not need to consider the side effects that a request should cause. 
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\code{POST} submits data to be processed (e.g., from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. This may result in the creation of a new resource or the updates of existing resources or both.
we use ‘get’ for scraping, ‘post’ is more complicated. Use it to navigate logins, popups, etc.
